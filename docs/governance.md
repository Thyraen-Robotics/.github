# Governance

## Scope and non-goals

- This repo is the org landing surface and a lightweight documentation hub.
- It does not host build steps, CI, or release pipelines.
- Product implementation details live in the product repositories.

## Architecture boundaries

Org-level architecture guidance and ecosystem contracts live here. Product-level architecture belongs in each product repository.

## Where workflows live

Engineering workflows (CI, release, testing, deployment) live in the product repositories. Cross-cutting process docs live here when they are org-wide.
