# Echelon

Echelon is the mission autonomy platform and collaborative C2 layer for the Thyraen ecosystem.
It provides canonical state, tasking, coordination, and the operator interface that binds the system together.

Key ideas:
- Canonical operational picture from heterogeneous sources
- Tasking and coordination across autonomous agents
- Contracts and adapters instead of bespoke coupling

For technical details, see the Echelon repository documentation.
