# Echelon

**Echelon** is the mission autonomy and mission command-and-control (C2) capability
within the Thyraen Robotics ecosystem.

Echelon provides the coordination, tasking, and operational coherence required for
autonomous agents to execute missions under human intent, across both centralized
and decentralized configurations.

It is not a platform or vehicle system.
Echelon is a **mission-level autonomy capability** that may operate onboard agents,
across distributed nodes, or as a coordinating mission service.

## Role in the Thyraen Ecosystem

Echelon serves as the **mission reasoning and coordination layer** that binds
autonomous activity into coherent mission execution.

It is responsible for:
- Representing shared mission state
- Translating intent into executable tasks
- Coordinating activity across agents and systems
- Providing mission-level visibility and control to operators

Other Thyraen capabilities, such as Breacher, are tasked and coordinated through
Echelon rather than operating independently.

## What Echelon Does

Echelon focuses on four core functions:

- **Mission state representation**  
  Maintaining a shared representation of entities, tasks, objectives, and constraints
  across participating agents and systems.

- **Tasking and coordination**  
  Creating, assigning, tracking, and managing mission tasks across single platforms
  and coordinated teams.

- **Mission adaptation**  
  Supporting task reallocation and execution adjustment in response to changing
  conditions, within defined constraints.

- **Mission C2 interaction**  
  Providing operators with situational awareness, task visibility, and mechanisms
  for intervention without micromanagement.

These functions operate at the mission layer rather than at the level of vehicle control.

## Autonomy and Deployment

Echelon supports multiple operational configurations depending on mission needs and
operating conditions.

It may:
- Execute onboard autonomous agents as a headless mission autonomy service
- Operate across multiple distributed nodes coordinating peer activity
- Function as a centralized mission coordination node when appropriate

These configurations may coexist within a single mission and do not require a fixed
deployment topology.

## Human Interaction

Echelon integrates humans as **mission authorities**.

Human operators:
- Define mission intent and objectives
- Establish constraints, priorities, and policies
- Supervise mission execution
- Intervene or approve actions as required

Echelon focuses on execution and coordination within those bounds, not on replacing
human command authority.

---

## What Echelon Is Not

Echelon is **not**:
- A flight controller or platform autonomy stack
- A vehicle-specific mission planner
- A requirement for centralized command
- A replacement for human decision-making

It is a mission-level autonomy and C2 capability designed to integrate with platform
autonomy systems and human operators.
