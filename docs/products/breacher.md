# Breacher

Breacher is the first autonomous capability built within the Thyraen ecosystem.
It focuses on operational preparation of the environment by shaping conditions so follow-on missions succeed.

Key ideas:
- Detect and localize threats
- Degrade or neutralize adversary sensing or control
- Operate across heterogeneous platforms under policy bounds

For technical details, see the Breacher repository documentation.
