# Breacher

**Breacher** is an autonomous capability within the Thyraen Robotics ecosystem focused on
**Operational Preparation of the Environment (OPE)** in denied or contested conditions.

Breacher addresses situations where environmental denial—such as electronic warfare,
sensing coverage, or control networks—constrains or prevents mission execution.

It is not a vehicle or a single platform.
Breacher is a **capability package** that may be instantiated across heterogeneous agents
and coordinated through Echelon.

## Role in the Thyraen Ecosystem

Breacher provides **battlespace shaping effects** that enable freedom of maneuver for
follow-on missions.

It is:
- Tasked and coordinated through **Echelon**
- Executed by platforms equipped with Breacher-capable sensors or effectors
- Assessed using shared mission state and corridor representations

Breacher functions as a specialized task family rather than a standalone system.

## What Breacher Does

Breacher focuses on three core functions:

- **Threat discovery and characterization**  
  Identifying and localizing emitters or systems that contribute to environmental denial.

- **Denial reduction**  
  Reducing the effectiveness of adversary sensing, communications, or control through
  bounded effects.

- **Corridor creation**  
  Establishing temporary or bounded regions of reduced risk that support maneuver,
  sensing, logistics, or other mission activities.

These functions are expressed as tasks and effects rather than platform-specific actions.

## Corridor Concept

A *corridor* represents a spatial and temporal region in which denial has been reduced
to a level compatible with mission execution.

Corridors are:
- Bounded in space and time
- Continuously reassessed
- Subject to residual risk

Corridor state is represented and tracked within Echelon rather than managed by
individual platforms.

## Autonomy and Control

Breacher operates under explicit policy and control constraints.

Depending on context, execution may involve:
- Autonomous task execution within defined bounds
- Supervised autonomy with human oversight
- Human-directed task initiation or approval

Human operators define **intent and constraints**.
Breacher focuses on execution within those bounds.

---

## What Breacher Is Not

Breacher is **not**:
- A specific air, ground, or maritime vehicle
- A monolithic electronic warfare system
- A guarantee of persistent or permanent denial effects
- A replacement for human command authority

It is a mission-level capability that integrates sensing, decision-making, and effects
under Echelon coordination.

## Relationship to Detailed Documentation

Operational concepts, platform integrations, and implementation specifics
are maintained in the Breacher product repository and controlled CONOP documentation.
