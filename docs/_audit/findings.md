# Findings

## Duplicates / conflicts

- Org landing content is single-sourced in `profile/README.md`. `README.md` is a short pointer to reduce duplication.

## Outdated or implementation-specific content

- No build steps, CI instructions, or repo tables remain in the org landing content.
- Product details are kept in product summaries only.

## Workflows / scripts

- No workflows or scripts exist in this repo; nothing to remove or disable.

## Notes

- Removed aspirational “vision” content from the public landing surface to stay audit-safe.
